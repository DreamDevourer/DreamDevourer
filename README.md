Hey world! I'm Nick üññ

I‚Äôm a multi-disciplinary product designer who‚Äôs delivered creative and engaging solutions across web design, Front-end Development, UI/UX design research and mobile applications. I'm more introvert than extrovert, I really have found an appreciation for working remotely but still connecting with lots of people daily. Yet, I still prefer ‚Äúcameras off‚Äù most days so I can pace around the house - lol that works a lot to think about good solutions!

My work can be seen at Remotish Agency website, that I designed and managed part of this huge project with a great and professional team! Another good place to see my work is at Maker Mockup, the largest mockups e-commerce in Brazil, the whole site is developed and designed by me with great care, quality and functionality. I accumulated remote international experience through many projects in United States, Germany, Mexico and Brazil. I really appreciate flexible work and different challenges in a fast-paced, high tech environment.

I love the process of building something new as well as finding and developing awesome people, be it my clients, employees, or networking relationships.

I have solid professional experience acquired in services, B2B and agency companies in the technology, development, design and WebOps areas.

My work has also been featured in GitHub, HubSpot DevPost, Dribbble and Behance with my WebOps Design and development for HubSpot ecosystem.

I also have Design graduation, Inbound marketing knowledge, Front-end development practical application and course, besides several Agile development courses and improvement courses in the areas of Design, Product Design, IT technologies, Remote Work Foundations and theirs convergence.

If you are interested in the prototyping of any website, Design System or App, please contact me!
